This dataset has 40 features (not including the class attribute), with 1000 instances.
Please wait while I normalize the data...

Do you want to Z Normalize the data values? (y/n): n

Running nearest neighbor with all the features, using “leaving-one-out” evaluation, we get an accuracy of  69.39999999999999 %
